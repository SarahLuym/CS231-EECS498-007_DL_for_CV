All PyTorch tensors also have a `device` attribute that specifies the device where the tensor is stored -- either CPU, or CUDA (for NVIDA GPUs). A tensor on a CUDA device will automatically use that device to accelerate all of its operations.\n","\n","Just as with datatypes, we can use the [`.to()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.1.0/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.to) method to change the device of a tensor. We can also use the convenience methods `.cuda()` and `.cpu()` methods to move tensors between CPU and GPU.
